                Hi! Kenneth here. I'm a first-year undergrad at UC San Diego studying Computer Science.
            </p>
            <p>
                My academic interest resides in solving problems at the intersection between <b>technology</b>, <b>society</b>, <b>individuals</b>, and the <b>economy</b>. How to make machine learning algorithms less prone to human biases? How to fix issues with our "Web 2.0" dominated by profit-hungry, data-seeking Internet giants? How can we further empower data &mdash; not for the sake of convenience, but humanity?
            </p>
            <p>
                I don't have a definite answer to those questions (tbh they're pretty broad), but because of them, at least I know why I want to enrich myself through higher education.
            </p>
            <p>
                Other than that... I'm enjoying Christ, learning to produce music, getting better at volleyball, reading, and attempting to cook <em>good</em> ramen for people I care about.
