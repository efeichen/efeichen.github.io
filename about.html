                Hi! Kenneth here. I'm currently an undergrad at <a href="https://ucsd.edu/">UC San Diego</a> studying Computer Science. I've also contributed to a research project at MIT CSAIL, but that's for another time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, my interests span from Artificial Intelligence, specifically how AI can be used to solve global or social challenges without infringing the data privacy of individual citizens, and Human-Computer Interaction, applying UI/UX principles, how could humans more effectively and efficiently utilize computational technologies and the data they create to accomplish complex tasks.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was born in NorCal, grew up in China, and glowed up in SoCal. I got into programming (C Language, specifically) in 7th grade, but didn't start seriously self-teaching until high school (Web Dev, this time), after finally gaining my parents' support.
