This is Kenneth Efei Chen’s personal website and online portfolio.

I’ve attempted to make my own website several times in the past. Most of them lasted for months before I was visually exhausted and decided to redesign it from scratch. This one is like my 4th iteration? I believe this is the one that will treat my picky eyes for a couple years. *(attach screenshots of past websites if found)*

## Software/Tools Used

Added this section for beginners. Because I want the development of this website to be a good practice, the majority of the code is plain HTML, CSS, and JS. The only external libraries used (as of May 2019) are [Font Awesome]([https://fontawesome.com](https://fontawesome.com/)) and [Typed.js](https://mattboldt.com/demos/typed-js/).

Notable software used:

1. VSCode: One of the best code editors available.
2. Typora: Markdown editor I’m using to edit this README. Functional and free!
3. ImageOptim: Optimize PNGs & JPGs to reduce file size and in turn make site more performant. Also free!  

*Might write an article about what I learned and link it here.*

## Credits

Many of the issues encountered during the designing & coding process were fixed by inspecting the website of others. The two websites that inspired/helped me the most are:

1. Shubheksha Jalan’s [website](https://shubheksha.com/)

2. Brian Ho’s [website](https://brianho.io/)

Thank you for making your portfolios awesome!

As for other resources, there are of course **Stack Overflow**, **CSS Tricks**, and the good ol' references on **MDN**.
